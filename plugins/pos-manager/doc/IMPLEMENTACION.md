# POS Manager — Implementation

A generic, configurable Point-of-Sale plugin: a cashier searches products, builds
a cart, and confirms a sale; the sale and its lines are recorded and each
product's stock is decremented **atomically and race-safely**. The plugin is
data-agnostic — it works with any tables you map in `config.php`.

## Install

1. The plugin is registered in `plugins/plugins-registry.php` (`url: pos-manager`).
2. Create the data tables it will use (products + sales + sale lines). Any
   tables work — e.g. create them with the CMS module builder.
3. Copy `config.example.php` → `config.php` and map every `table`/column to your
   tables (see the config contract). `config.php` is gitignored.
4. Create a CMS page so the register shows in the sidebar:
   `type_page = custom`, `url_page = pos-manager`, `icon_page = bi-cash-coin`,
   `title_page = Caja (POS)`.

## Configuration

Configuration is normally **visual**: a superadmin opens the ⚙ button in the POS
screen and maps tables/columns from dropdowns, manages payment methods, and sets
per-cashier permissions. It is stored in a `pos_settings` table the plugin
creates lazily. `config.example.php` documents the same shape as an optional file
fallback (the DB settings take precedence).

Groups: `product`, `sale`, `sale_item` (table + column names), plus
`roles_allowed`, `payment_methods`, `completed_status`.

### Optional capabilities

- **Manual line items**: map `sale_item.name` (a name column on the line table)
  to let cashiers add free items (name + price) that don't touch stock.
- **Discounts**: map `sale.discount` to allow a per-sale discount (clamped to the
  subtotal; total = subtotal − discount).
- **Per-cashier permissions** (`permissions`): `discount` is the list of admin ids
  allowed to apply discounts; `payments[id]` restricts a cashier to a subset of
  payment methods. Absent = unrestricted. Superadmins always bypass. Enforced
  server-side in `createSale` and reflected in the cashier UI.

## How the atomic stock decrement works

On `create_sale` the controller opens one PDO transaction and, per line, runs:

```sql
UPDATE <product_table>
   SET <stock> = <stock> - :qty
 WHERE <id> = :pid AND <stock> >= :qty AND <active> = 1;
-- requires rowCount() === 1, else the whole sale is rolled back
```

Because the check (`stock >= qty`) and the decrement are a single statement,
InnoDB row locks serialize concurrent sales of the last unit: exactly one wins
and stock never goes negative. Prices and totals are recomputed server-side and
never trusted from the client.

## Security

- All table/column names from config are validated against `^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$`
  before use; all values are bound parameters (no string interpolation of data).
- `ajax.php` requires an admin session, a role in `roles_allowed`, and a valid
  CSRF token on `create_sale`.
- Sales are immutable (no edit/void in this version).
- `logActivity('create','sale',id)` records each sale.

## AJAX actions

`search_products` (read), `create_sale` (write, CSRF), `get_receipt` (read).
See the contracts in `specs/002-bakery-management/contracts/` for the full shapes.
